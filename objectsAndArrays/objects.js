//? DOT NOTATION
// While we use bracket notation with arrays, we use something called DOT NOTATION for objects.

// We are capable of utilizing bracket notations as well

//? JSON Objects
/*

    - JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
    - The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript Object Notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only.
    -JSON exists as a string - useful when you want to fetch data from a server.
    - needs to be converted to a native JS object if you want to acess it.

/*
 - object bracket notationcan also allow us to find a value in an object.
 - using object bracket notation can be handy if we want to store a  key in a variable and then use that vaariable to parse through an object.
 - this works because ALL keys in an object are STRINGS.
